# C
 The work i have done in C includes codes for a turtle game, a calendar and some data structures. The calendar is written as a program that runs in the terminal and tells the user the next day of a date entered by the user. The required date format is day-month-year. In the turtle game, the goal is for the user to maneuver the turtle (@) within specified dimensions, avoiding falling into holes (0), and consuming all the berries (*) without running out of energy. The movement commands are mn, me, ms, and mw, where "m" signifies movement and "n", "e", "s", "w" represent directions (north, east, south, west). To consume a berry, the commands are en, ee, es, ew, where the first letter indicates eating and the second letter represents the direction. Consuming a berry increases energy by 10 points.(There is no difference between typing lowercase or uppercase letters on the keyboard)
